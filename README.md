I am a maniac when it comes to a new language. I have to dig deeper and understand how the language works within the Operating System and the related layers of architecture.

I am originally from Italy where I started my own company http://ubqart.com/ and since then I never stopped coding 

I am a fan of games with incredibly complex phisics and I enjoy exploring Unity during the freetime
