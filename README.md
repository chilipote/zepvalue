# **Hello World!**

I am Zep,

I love to learn new languages and work on side projects. I am a maniac when it comes to a new language: I have to dig deeper and understand how the language works with the Operating System and the related layers in architecture.

I am originally from Italy where I started my own company http://ubqart.com/ and since then I never stopped coding 

I am a fan of games with incredibly complex phisics and I enjoy exploring Unity during the freetime
